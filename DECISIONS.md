## 005. A new Vultr server in New Jersey, just for Summit Air

Decided: run the tool server and the voice program on a new Vultr server (2 vCPU, 4 GB, New Jersey, Ubuntu 24.04, $20 a month billed hourly), not on the existing shared server.
Why: the shared server runs Epic's client services, is too small for 5 calls at once, gives us no admin rights (so it needed an ngrok tunnel) and sits in Atlanta. The new one is the cheapest option in the New York area, uses the existing Vultr account, isolates Summit Air from client work, and can be deleted after the interview.
Considered: keeping or resizing the shared server; DigitalOcean (New York) and Akamai Linode (Newark) at about $24 a month; Hetzner (prices unclear after its 2026 increases, not near New York); usage-billed platforms such as Fly.io (no saving for an always-on program).
Would change if: call volume needs more than about 5 calls at once (resize, or add a second server as a hot spare).

## 004. Build our own LiveKit stack, with Retell as the baseline it has to beat

Decided: option D. The product is our own stack: Deepgram, a Claude model and Cartesia, run by our program on our own server, with LiveKit's free plan connecting the phone line. A quick Retell setup on the existing 678 number is the baseline. Both are scored on the same eval scenarios plus 10 real phone calls each; the winner keeps the new NYC Twilio number and the other voice folder is deleted.
Why: our own stack lets server code decide every hang-up and transfer (Retell's tools can't end a call or veto its built-in transfer), lets each part be swapped or right-sized, and appears to match how Revin's voice team builds. Retell is the strongest managed option, so beating it on real calls is the evidence; it costs a few hours because the tool server, prompts and evals are shared.
Considered: LiveKit only (no evidence it beats a managed platform), Retell only (polished, but our code can't stop a hang-up and we can only turn its dials), Retell with our own model through its custom LLM mode (keeps Retell's turn-taking but still tied to Retell), Vapi (the same trade as Retell with no head start) and Pipecat (the same trade as LiveKit, with less sign Revin uses it).
Would change if: the Retell baseline beats our stack on turn-taking or reply speed on real phone calls, in which case Retell, possibly in custom LLM mode, becomes the product.

## 003. The mock sells technician-windows, not counters
Decided: In the mock ServiceTitan, a slot is one technician in one arrival window on one day. Open capacity is technicians on shift with the right skills, minus those booked, minus a few held for urgent jobs. A database constraint allows one live appointment per technician per window.
Why: A counter can go wrong under parallel requests; a unique row cannot. It also gives skill matching, an on-call technician and a real technician to put in the job.
Considered: A capacity table with a count per window and business unit (simpler, but needs extra locking to be safe).
Would change if: Real ServiceTitan capacity turns out to be count-based and the adapter needs the same shape from the mock.

## 002. Test with our own harness, scored by code first

Decided: our own pytest harness. A simulated caller talks in text to the real prompts and tool server on a scratch database. Code checks on the tool-call log and saved records decide pass or fail; an LLM grader scores conversation quality and can fail a run the code passed, never rescue one it failed. About 10 real audio calls are added once the voice platform is chosen. A quick run is about 8 scenarios (about $1, ASSUMED); the full suite runs only at a release gate (about $15, ASSUMED).
Why: the rules that matter (safety lines before anything else, read-back before booking, no commercial bookings) live in server code, so only a harness that reads server state can prove them. The earlier practice agent's worst bugs were ordering bugs that a transcript judge misses and a tool-log check catches exactly.
Considered: the voice platform's own simulator (Retell's can't check tool arguments or the database; LiveKit's only works if LiveKit wins), a general eval framework such as promptfoo or Braintrust (adds a dependency without removing the harness), hosted voice testing such as Cekura, Coval or Hamming (judges from outside the call, unpublished pricing).
Would change if: LiveKit wins the platform decision and our harness grows past about 500 lines, in which case LiveKit's test helpers take over the per-turn checks.
